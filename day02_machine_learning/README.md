# Breast Cancer Dataset — Classification Models

## 1. Linear Regression (Baseline Model)

### Objective
Implemented Linear Regression as a baseline model to establish the preprocessing pipeline and evaluate how a regression-based approach performs on a classification-type dataset.

### Workflow
- Data loading and preprocessing  
- Handling categorical variables  
- Train-test split  
- Model training and evaluation  

### Results
- Accuracy: 81%  
- Served as an initial benchmark before applying classification algorithms  

### Dataset
Breast Cancer dataset (`breast-cancer.csv`)  
- 286 rows  
- 9 features  
- Target variable: recurrence / no recurrence  

### Key Insight
Linear Regression provided a baseline reference but is not ideal for classification problems.

## 2. Logistic Regression

### Objective
Applied Logistic Regression for binary classification including preprocessing, training, evaluation, and result visualization.

### Workflow
- Feature preprocessing  
- Train-test split  
- Model training  
- Evaluation using Accuracy and ROC-AUC  
- Visualization of results  

### Results
- Accuracy: 69%  
- ROC-AUC: 0.60  

### Output
`outputs/logistic_regression_results.png`

### Key Insight
Logistic Regression provided probabilistic outputs suitable for classification, though performance was moderate on this dataset.

# Heart Disease Dataset — Predictive Modeling

Dataset: `heart.csv`  
- 303 rows  
- 13 features  
- Target: presence or absence of heart disease  
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

## 1. Decision Tree Classifier

### Objective
Built and optimized a Decision Tree classifier to predict heart disease using supervised machine learning techniques.

### Workflow
- Exploratory Data Analysis (statistical summary, correlation heatmap, boxplots)  
- Train-test split  
- Model training  
- Hyperparameter tuning (max_depth)  
- Evaluation and visualization  

### Model Performance
- Initial Accuracy: ~0.80  
- Best Accuracy: 0.836  
- Optimal max_depth: 5  
- GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV used for optimization  

### Observations
- Moderate depth improved accuracy  
- Very deep trees increased complexity without significant gain  
- Overfitting risk increases with high depth  
- Controlled complexity improves interpretability

## 2. Random Forest Classifier

### Objective
Developed a Random Forest classifier to improve predictive performance using ensemble learning.

### Model Configuration
- n_estimators: 100  
- max_depth: 5  

### Evaluation Metrics

| Metric   | Score |
|----------|-------|
| Accuracy | 0.80  |
| ROC-AUC  | 0.91  |

### Output
`outputs/random_forest_results.png`

### Key Insight
Random Forest improved overall predictive stability and achieved a high ROC-AUC score, demonstrating the effectiveness of ensemble methods over single-tree models.
