# Breast Cancer Dataset — Classification Models

## 1. Linear Regression (Baseline Model)

### Objective
Implemented Linear Regression as a baseline model to establish the preprocessing pipeline and evaluate how a regression-based approach performs on a classification-type dataset.

### Workflow
- Data loading and preprocessing  
- Handling categorical variables  
- Train-test split  
- Model training and evaluation  

### Results
- Accuracy: 81%  
- Served as an initial benchmark before applying classification algorithms  

### Dataset
Breast Cancer dataset (`breast-cancer.csv`)  
- 286 rows  
- 9 features  
- Target variable: recurrence / no recurrence  

### Key Insight
Linear Regression provided a baseline reference but is not ideal for classification problems.

## 2. Logistic Regression

### Objective
Applied Logistic Regression for binary classification including preprocessing, training, evaluation, and result visualization.

### Workflow
- Feature preprocessing  
- Train-test split  
- Model training  
- Evaluation using Accuracy and ROC-AUC  
- Visualization of results  

### Results
- Accuracy: 69%  
- ROC-AUC: 0.60  

### Output

## 1. Decision Tree Classifier

### Objective
Built and optimized a Decision Tree classifier to predict heart disease using supervised machine learning techniques.

### Workflow
- Exploratory Data Analysis (statistical summary, correlation heatmap, boxplots)  
- Train-test split  
- Model training  
- Hyperparameter tuning (max_depth)  
- Evaluation and visualization  

### Model Performance

#Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier

#Objective
Applied Support Vector Machine (SVM) for binary classification to identify an optimal decision boundary between classes.

#Workflow
Data preprocessing and feature scaling
Train-test split
SVM model training
Evaluation using Accuracy and ROC-AUC

#Results
Accuracy: ~0.82
ROC-AUC: ~0.88

Key Insight
SVM showed strong performance on the dataset when proper feature scaling was applied, making it an effective classifier for structured healthcare data.
# Day 02 — K-Means Clustering (Heart Disease Dataset)

## Objective
Built a K-Means clustering model on the Heart Disease dataset
covering preprocessing, elbow method to find optimal K, cluster
analysis, PCA visualization and silhouette score evaluation.

## Model
K-Means Clustering — n_clusters: 2 | Scikit-learn

## Result
| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Silhouette Score | 0.167 |
| Optimal K | 2 |
| Cluster 0 | 195 samples |
| Cluster 1 | 108 samples |

## Key Finding
Silhouette Score was highest at K=2 (0.167) confirming 2 clusters
is optimal — aligning with binary nature of heart disease data.
PCA visualization shows clear separation between the two clusters.

## Dataset
Heart Disease Dataset — heart.csv — 303 rows — 13 features
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

## Tools Used
Python | Pandas | NumPy | Scikit-learn | Matplotlib | Seaborn

## Output
